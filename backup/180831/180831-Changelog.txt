Markings:
- Implement a log output system (changing all println to output.println would work, but some of the printlns has commas. Annoying)
- Make a "free play" mode. (no week limit, or rather, 256 weeks)
- Further increase the frequency of resource spawning.
- Balancing issues.
- Refer to development notes





Known Bugs:
- Save file not saving "effectTakingPlace" variables

+ OLD BUGS
- Inconsistency of "entered zone" detection in Priest Bee training course.
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
1. use .clear() if you want to reset an ArrayList. not set it to new ArrayList.
2. in tutorial.pde, the 4-lined code for tipbox formatting is redundant. use the function tipboxFontFormat() instead.

- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower logic is ambigious ; quite difficult to force the bee out of the flower
