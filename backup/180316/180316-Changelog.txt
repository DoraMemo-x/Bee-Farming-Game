Enhancements:
+ Quest
- Added a "Quest" system. [need further testing] (Should treat it as alternate gamemode.)
  -> Game no longer ends after 15 weeks.
  -> Game now ends if the player cannot finish any quest in time.
  -> Quests consist of CONTENT, DIFFICULTY, DEADLINE and REWARD.
     => CONTENT means the requirements to finish the quest. (6 types)
     => DIFFICULTY is the measure of how difficult the quest is.
     => DEADLINE is the deadline. Simple as that.
     => REWARD is granted to the player after the completion of a quest. (15 types)


+ Result Card
- Added a game-over screen which grades the player's performance.
  -> Performance evaluation consists of several elements, recorded through the game.


+ Save
- Saving can now store up to 256 weeks.
- Saving now stores more guardian data.
- Saving also saves the quest info.
- Saving also saves the result card info.



Bug Fixes:
- Fixed the flawed check update logic.
- Fixed a bug where the honeyKg info is not stored.
- Fixed a bug where enemies are not affected by hunting guardian's debuff aura. (due to the introduction of "speed correction")





Markings:
- Implement a log output system (changing all println to output.println would work, but some of the printlns has commas. Annoying)
- Make a "free play" mode. (no week limit, or rather, 99 weeks)
- Further increase the frequency of resource spawning.





Known Bugs:
+ OLD BUGS
- Inconsistency of "entered zone" detection in Priest Bee training course.
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
1. use .clear() if you want to reset an ArrayList. not set it to new ArrayList.
2. change all distance_between_two_points() to dist(). However the xy parameters are mixed up...
3. in tutorial.pde, the 4-lined code for tipbox formatting is redundant. use the function tipboxFontFormat() instead.

- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower logic is ambigious ; quite difficult to force the bee out of the flower
