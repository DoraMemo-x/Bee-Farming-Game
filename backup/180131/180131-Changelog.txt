Enhancements:
- Added check update algorithm. A button is available to link to the download page if the current version is older than the latest version.
- Added load conditions for save system.
  -> if it is not a valid save, loadError.txt will be produced, logging the error cause.
  -> if a save is not found, it will not be loaded.
- Load save is now also available in the menu screen.

- Added 3 demonstrations (1.5 guardians) in G.Training tab.
- Training tabs now contain the training course text-based tutorial. (Collapsible)

- Lowered the lower limit for resource timer to spawn.

- Added a "charge bar" to show the honey against honey limit.





Bug Fixes:
- Hotfix: Multiple bee movements
- Dead bees are now properly (completely) removed after a round.





Markings:
- Look into a "grading system" in end-game screen. (like Cuphead)
- Maybe add "optional missions" in order to continue the game. (like 100% OJ)
- Record more statistics for the player to view in end-game screen.
- Make a "free play" mode. (no week limit, or rather, 99 weeks)
- Further increase the frequency of resource spawning.





Known Bugs:
+ BEE TRAINING
- Inconsistency of "entered zone" detection in Priest Bee training course.

+ OLD BUGS
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
1. use .clear() if you want to reset an ArrayList. not set it to new ArrayList.
2. change all distance_between_two_points() to dist(). However the xy parameters are mixed up...
3. in tutorial.pde, the 4-lined code for tipbox formatting is redundant. use the function tipboxFontFormat() instead.

- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower   logic is ambigious ; quite difficult to force the bee out of the fucking flower
