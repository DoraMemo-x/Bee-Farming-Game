Known Bugs:
+ BEE TRAINING
- Inconsistency of "entered zone" detection in Priest Bee training course.

+ OLD BUGS
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
1. use .clear() if you want to reset an ArrayList. not set it to new ArrayList.
2. change all distance_between_two_points() to dist(). However the xy parameters are mixed up...
3. in tutorial.pde, the 4-lined code for tipbox formatting is redundant. use the function tipboxFontFormat() instead.

- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower   logic is ambigious ; quite difficult to force the bee out of the fucking flower
