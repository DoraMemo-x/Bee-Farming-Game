Bug Fixes:
+ INVENTORY
    - Fixed a bug in bee inventory, where if a dead bee is sold, the icons go inconsistent
    - Minimap now updates when a bee is sold
    - Now removes inventoryBees before setting its values to DEAD.
    - Ranged guardian icons are now consistent: inventory & minimap

- Fixed a bug where sometimes, entities do not reach their assigned target. (forceful correction -> "Stucking to border" fix)
- Fixed a bug in the first hornet forest where the next hornet timer is bugged
- Fixed a bug where hornets are not removed from the forest when all bees are dead
- Fixed a bug for training courses: now forestScreen round over, while GTOngoing, consistently changes to trainingScreen and show the result.

    


Known Bugs:
+ OLD BUGS
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower   logic is ambigious - quite difficult to force the bee out of the fucking flower
