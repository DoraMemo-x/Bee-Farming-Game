180123 ChangeLog:

Enhancements:
- Added all the resource images
- Added stage-based flower images for gardening bee course
- Lowered the cost to purchase each training course for all of them
- Increased the honey range of flowers from forest glow and above
- Enhanced control of Bouncer Guardian
- Mouse range now matches the beehive shape (even when upgraded)

+ FLOWERS
- Lowered the spawn time of flowers after the factor exceeds a certain number
- Added a chance-based "additional flower" spawning line (always true if flower size is 1 at the moment of trigger)
- Made the honey capacity of flowers near the border of the screen higher. (Reasons: see dev notes)
- Flowers now won't spawn near beehive
- Flower honey capacity now has distinct colours, matching its stamen colour.

+ TECHNICAL
- Speed correction due to frame drop
- Bouncer guardian removed targetID[1] (not necessary)


Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the inventory buttons are greyed out even when the player is not in that inventory
- Fixed a bug where the dead banner is still drawn even though the dead bee has been removed, due to the variable isBeeDead not being updated
- Fixed a bug when the player has too many high-class bees in a lower tier forest, the flower spawn system bugs out (does not spawn flowers anymore)   - Fixed a bug where if the player JUST manages to finish the training course, and the time passes during the 5s countdown timer is shown, the training counted as a fail

+ Bouncer Guardian
- Fixed a bug in the Bouncer Guardian course, where the disguised ladybugs are not correctly coloured
- Fixed misdirecting target bug


Known Bugs:
+ BEE TRAINING
- Inconsistency of "entered zone" detection in Priest Bee training course.

+ OLD BUGS
- In the Royal Guardian training course, guardian would often get stucked on borders and end up using the "stucked to border fix" which is not optimal
- When selected a guardian and pressed the beehive, it will not move towards it
- On rare occasions the bees (happee+) cannot enter beehive. (not first person experience)

+ CODE CLEANUP NOTES!!!
1. use .clear() if you want to reset an ArrayList. not set it to new ArrayList.
2. change all distance_between_two_points() to dist(). However the xy parameters are mixed up...
3. in tutorial.pde, the 4-lined code for tipbox formatting is redundant. use the function tipboxFontFormat() instead.

- Interation between bee and flower have lots of unnecessary variables
- Pick honey, go in flower, tell bee it's not inside flower   logic is ambigious ; quite difficult to force the bee out of the fucking flower
